To determine if there is a significant difference in the mean improvement scores between Group A 
and Group B, we can conduct a t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) assumes that there is no significant 
difference between the two groups, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) assumes that there is a 
significant difference.


Ans-a)
Let's perform the t-test using the given data:

For Group A:
Mean improvement score (x̄1) = 2.5
Standard deviation (s1) = 0.8
Sample size (n1) = 30


For Group B:
Mean improvement score (x̄2) = 2.2
Standard deviation (s2) = 0.6
Sample size (n2) = 30


We can use the two-sample independent t-test formula, which compares the means of two independent groups:

t = (x̄1 - x̄2) / sqrt((s1^2 / n1) + (s2^2 / n2))


Plugging in the values:
t = (2.5 - 2.2) / sqrt((0.8^2 / 30) + (0.6^2 / 30))


Calculating:
t = 0.3 / sqrt(0.02133 + 0.012)
t ≈ 0.3 / sqrt(0.03333)
t ≈ 0.3 / 0.18257
t ≈ 1.642



Ans-b)
Since the p-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected. There is evidence to suggest 
that there is a difference in the mean improvement scores between the two groups. The new drug appears 
to be more effective than the standard drug in treating the condition.
