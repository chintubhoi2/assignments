A correlation coefficient of 0.7 indicates a strong positive relationship between SAT scores and college GPA.
This means that there is a significant tendency for students with higher SAT scores to have higher college 
GPAs, and vice versa. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, with 0 indicating no correlation, 
-1 indicating a perfect negative correlation, and 1 indicating a perfect positive correlation. In this case,
a correlation coefficient of 0.7 suggests a relatively strong positive relationship between SAT scores and 
college GPA. It's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. While a strong positive 
correlation suggests that higher SAT scores are associated with higher college GPAs, it does not necessarily
mean that high SAT scores cause high GPAs. Other factors, such as study habits, motivation, and personal
circumstances, can also influence college performance.
